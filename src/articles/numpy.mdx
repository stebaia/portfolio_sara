## Getting Started with NumPy

**NumPy** is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Whether you're working on data analysis, machine learning, or scientific simulations, NumPy is essential for performing fast and efficient numerical computations.

## Key Features of NumPy

- **ndarray (N-dimensional array):** A powerful object for storing multi-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types.
- **Mathematical Functions:** Built-in functions for linear algebra, statistical analysis, random number generation, and more.
- **Broadcasting:** A feature that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit looping.
- **Integration with Other Libraries:** NumPy works seamlessly with other scientific libraries like SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- **Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays are more compact and efficient than Python lists, making them ideal for large datasets.

## Setting Up a Simple NumPy Project

To get started with NumPy, you'll first need to install the library. You can do this using `pip`:

### Step 1: Install NumPy

To install NumPy, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
