## Getting Started with Laravel

**Laravel** is a robust and elegant PHP framework used for web application development. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern and provides an expressive and clean syntax for developers. Laravel makes common tasks such as routing, authentication, sessions, and caching easier, making it one of the most popular PHP frameworks for modern web development.

## Key Features of Laravel

- **Routing:** Laravel’s routing system allows you to define all the routes of your application easily, making the process of handling HTTP requests simple and efficient.
- **Eloquent ORM:** Laravel’s Eloquent ORM (Object Relational Mapper) provides a simple and elegant ActiveRecord implementation for interacting with databases.
- **Blade Templating:** Blade is Laravel’s lightweight templating engine, which allows you to write clean and reusable templates with minimal syntax.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Laravel provides built-in features for user authentication and authorization, including login, registration, password reset, and more.
- **Artisan Command-Line Interface:** Artisan is Laravel's command-line tool that provides various helpful commands for common tasks, such as migrations, testing, and queue management.
- **Laravel Ecosystem:** Laravel has a rich ecosystem that includes tools like **Laravel Horizon** (for managing queues), **Laravel Forge** (for server management), and **Laravel Vapor** (for serverless deployment).
