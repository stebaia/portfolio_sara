## Introduction to TensorFlow

**TensorFlow** is an open-source framework developed by Google for building machine learning and deep learning models. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries to facilitate building, training, and deploying machine learning models in production environments.

## Key Features of TensorFlow

- **Comprehensive ML Support**: TensorFlow supports various machine learning algorithms including neural networks, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning.
- **Keras Integration**: TensorFlow integrates seamlessly with Keras, a high-level neural networks API, simplifying the process of building and training models.
- **Scalability**: It can be run on a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to large-scale distributed systems.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: A lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and embedded devices.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Run TensorFlow models directly in the browser using JavaScript.

## Getting Started with TensorFlow

To start using TensorFlow, you need to install it in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
