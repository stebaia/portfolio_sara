## Getting Started with Spring Framework

The **Spring Framework** is a powerful framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, with a strong emphasis on simplicity, testability, and flexibility. Whether you are developing a web application, microservices, or batch applications, Spring offers a wide range of modules to make development easier and more efficient.

## Key Features of Spring Framework

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** Spring manages object creation and dependencies.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Allows separation of concerns like logging, transaction management, etc.
- **Data Access:** Supports various databases and APIs, such as JDBC, Hibernate, and JPA.
- **Spring MVC:** A powerful web framework for building RESTful services and traditional web apps.
- **Spring Security:** Provides comprehensive security features, including authentication, authorization, and protection against attacks.

## Setting Up a Simple Spring Boot Application

Spring Boot is a subproject of Spring that simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications. It provides production-ready defaults for application configurations, which significantly reduces the setup time and effort.

### Step 1: Add Spring Boot Dependencies

Start by creating a simple Spring Boot application using Maven or Gradle. In your `pom.xml` (for Maven), add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
